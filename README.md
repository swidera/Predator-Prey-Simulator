# Predator-Prey-Simulator
Predator Prey Simulation of Ants and Critters in C++. This simulator takes user input for the size of a grid, the number of ants, the
number of doodlebugs, and then executes the simulator iterating through a number of steps stated by the user (visualized on the grid
one at a time). After the simulation is done, the user is prompted if they wish to continue or not. This program was part of a group 
project at Oregon State University with a few others working on the program as well.
